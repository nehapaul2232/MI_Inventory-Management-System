# MI_Inventory-Management-System

The primary purpose of making the Inventory Management System is to create an easy
way for the shop owners to access the inventory of the store and access stocks using
Emu8086.
In this Inventory Management System, the owners of shops can easily maintain and keep
track of each item in the store. This will also be useful, to quickly generate bills for every
purchase made by a customer in the shop.
This project is implemented in the 8086 Microprocessor Emulator (emu8086) using
assembly language.
